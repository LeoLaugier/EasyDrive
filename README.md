# EasyDrive
• EasyDrive is both an entrepreneurial and academic project of remote driving analysis through the Internet of Things.

• We have conceived a tool for decision support towards car fleet managers and private clients. We have targeted companies of private cars, carpooling, car sharing, delivering, renting, conveyors, and insurers to respond to their need in automatic rating of driving parameters (safety, comfort and energy-efficient driving).

• After one school year, our team have achieved its original goals by producing a Plug & Play device (called EasySensor) connected to an up and running application to analyze driving (called EasyApp).

• EasySensor was financed by Objenious ( Bouygues Telecom subsidiary) and CentraleSupélec. It is made of an Arduino board to collect driving data from an accelerometer, a GPS and a Bluetooth OBD connector. It sends the preprocessed data on the LoRaWan network towards Objenious servers.

• EasyApp gathers the preprocessed data from Objenious servers to analyse it on our servers and rate rides. We display the results on the Django website with the Google Maps API, the Google Chart API and the AdminLTE Control Model Template.
